# Template Idea

*This* idea is probably the best I've had...

Feel free to copy this file into the `_ideas` folder and rename it to `XXXX-idea-name.md`.
You can then edit the [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) at the top of the file.

**Please keep the status as 'In Review'**

Your idea will then either be 'Accepted' or 'Rejected' by an administrator.
